# Numerical Methods in Julia

This Jupyter notebook serves as supplementary material to the Julia code from the book [Numerical Methods for Scientific Computing](https://www.equalsharepress.com/media/NMFSC.pdf). These code snippets are minimal working examples and toy algorithms meant to better understand the mathematics behind many important numerical methods for scientific computing. The code was written and tested in Julia version 1.7.2.
