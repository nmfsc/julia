# Numerical Methods in Julia

This Jupyter notebook serves as supplementary material to the Julia code from the book [Numerical Methods for Scientific Computing](https://www.equalsharepress.com/media/NMFSC.pdf). These code snippets are minimal working examples and toy algorithms meant to better understand the mathematics behind many important numerical methods for scientific computing.
